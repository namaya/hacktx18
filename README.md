# DIY Virtual Assitant

## Description

Unfortunately, we were unable to deploy our application so you won't be able to see it in action on your machine.

The general idea is a DIY virtual assistant which would work something like this.

A DIY user pings The Home Depot facebook page and says they are interested in a certain project, and have the option of adding an image of a previously completed project. The virtual assistant then uses NLP and Image Classification to ping back with a list of tools and materials the user will need to complete such a project.

It's a pretty simple idea but one that would enhance The Home Depot's customer experience.
